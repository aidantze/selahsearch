You came from heavens throne
Acquainted with our sorrow
To trade the debt we owe
Your suffering for our freedom

The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out, my sin erased
It was my death You died, I am raised to life
Hallelujah, the lamb of God

My name upon Your heart
My shame upon Your shoulders
The power of sin undone, oooh
The cross for my salvation

There is no greater love
There is no greater love
The Savior lifted up
There is no greater love
