I have seen my Father's glory
Revealed in Jesus Christ
And the more that I behold Him
The more He satisfies
When I gaze upon His beauty
When I see Him as I should
Then my eyes are lifted upward
For His glory and my good

There is hope in every trial
For I can trust the Lord
He will turn my heart towards Him
And help me bear the thorn
So in faith, I follow Jesus
On the road not understood
For I know that He is working
For His glory and my good

To our God be the glory, to our God be praise
He alone, the name above all names
I will boast ever only in the Lord, my God
For I know His glory is my good

See the open arms of Jesus
Upon the cross that day
What they understood as weakness
Deserves my every praise
For the charge that was against me
It was nailed into the wood
Yes, I know that He has saved me
For His glory and my good

Would I gladly be made nothing
That Christ would be made more?
Would I seek the only kingdom
That far outweighs them all?
I will stand before my Father
Where the faithful saints have stood
And with joy, my heart shall praise Him
For His glory and my good
And with joy, my heart shall praise Him
For His glory and my good
