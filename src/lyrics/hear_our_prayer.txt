Hear our prayer, God above
As we come to you and seek your patient love
Hear our hearts, hear our minds
Hear the echoes of the words we cannot find

Be our hope, be our guide
In our wanderings of weakness, break our pride
Not for ease shall we pray
But for strength that we may walk with you this day

So we pray in faith, "Your will be done"
As we long to see your kingdom come
We ask with one voice
We ask with one voice
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord

Hear our prayer, faithful one
Shape our yearnings to the gospel of your Son
Free our hearts, free our minds
From the war that sin will wage 'til you arrive

Be our joy, be our stay
Give us eyes to see you answer prayer this day
Hear us praise all you've done
We rejoice as we receive the victory won
