Your word is good, it’s ever faithful
Worth more than gold, the heart’s delight
Your word gives life to all who hear and obey
Your word endures forever

Your word is true, it never changes
It formed the earth; sustains it still
Your word defends; providing refuge and strength
Your word endures forever

Your word is a lamp unto my feet
Your word is a light unto my path
For your word is my hope, it’s my joy and my song
Your word endures forever

Your word transforms, it lifts the humble
Rebukes the proud, protects the poor
Your word discerns the mind and spirit of all
Your word endures forever

Your word is more than just letters on pages
It’s life and it's love and it's freedom for us
Your word is more than just wisdom of ages
Its treasures are endless, it's always enough
Your word is more than just stories of old
It's the truth and the way and the story of love
Your word is more than just breath into dust
It’s your Son, as a man, come to dwell here with us
