Come and stand amazed, you people
See how God is reconciled!
See his plans of love accomplished
See his gift, this newborn child
See the Mighty, weak and tender
See the Word who now is mute
See the Sovereign without splendor
See the Fullness destitute

See how humankind received him;
See him wrapped in swaddling bands
Who as Lord of all creation
Rules the wind by his commands
See him lying in a manger
Without sign of reasoning;
Word of God to flesh surrendered
He is wisdom's crown, our King

O Lord Jesus, God incarnate
Who assumed this humble form
Counsel me and let my wishes
To your perfect will conform
Light of life, dispel my darkness
Let your frailty strengthen me;
Let your meekness give me boldness
Let your burden set me free;

O Emmanuel, my savior
Let your death be life for me
