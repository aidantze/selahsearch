And I hear the savior say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness, watch and pray
Find in me thine all in all

'Cause Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

O praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead
