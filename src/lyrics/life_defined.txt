Would you be my life oh I surrender
One day is better
With you than all the world
Oh Spirit of life
Help me remember
That it is my pleasure
To say to You that

All I am my life defined
By I've been crucified with Christ
The life I live I live by faith
In Jesus Christ who lives in me

When my heart grows cold
And my flesh is failing
The Spirit is willing
To point me back to You
For to live is Christ
And to die is better
Help me remember my song to You is

Remember His atoning
His body broken for me
Remember His approval
He gave His life to say so
Remember His appealing
My Lord is interceding
Remember if you have breath
To breathe it out and praise Him
