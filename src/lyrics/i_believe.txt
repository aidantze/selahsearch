I believe there is one salvation
One doorway that leads to life
One redemption, one confession
I believe in the name of Jesus Christ

I believe in the crucifixion
By His blood, I have been set free
I believe in the resurrection
Hallelujah, His life is death's defeat

All praise to God the Father
All praise to Christ the Son
All praise to the Holy Spirit
Our God has overcome
The King who was and is and evermore will be
In Jesus mighty name, I believe

I believe in the hope of Heaven
He's preparing a place for me
Far beyond what hearts imagine
Ears have heard or eyes have seen

I believe that a day is coming
He's returning to claim His bride
Light the altar, keep it burning
See the Lamb who rose a roaring Lion

No, I'll never be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
How could I ever walk away from the One who saved my life?
