God is great, give Him all the praise
Hallelujah, Name above all names
Fire in His eyes, healing in His veins
Everywhere, His glory on display
Take a look at those stars, He can name 'em all
Before His throne every knee falls
The demons have to run, the angels have to praise
Even the winds and waves obey

Our God is an awesome God, He reigns
From Heaven above with wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God, He reigns
From Heaven above with wisdom (with wisdom), power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

And even when I ran, He didn't run away
He came and put death back in its place
Friday on a cross, broken for my shame
Sunday morning rose up from that grave
Take a look at those scars on His hands and feet
He saved our souls for eternity
Worthy is the Lamb, glory to the King
Oh, let all the saints and the angels sing

Eyes on the sky, there will be a day
He will come and wipe our tears away
No more fear, no more pain
No more sorrow, sin or shame
The King is coming back again
A reign of love that will never end
For everything You've done and everything You do
And everything You are, I'll sing to You

My God, You're an awesome God
You're great in all You do
I'm made to worship You
My God, You're an awesome God
