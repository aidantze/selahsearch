Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation! 
O my soul, praise him, for he is your health and salvation! 
All you who hear, now to his temple draw near, praise him in glad adoration.

Praise to the Lord, who has fearfully, wondrously, made us;
Shelters us under his wings and so gently sustains us. 
Have you not seen all you have needed has been granted because he ordains it?

Praise to the Lord, who does prosper your work and defend you.    
Surely his goodness and mercy will daily attend you.
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do, if with his love he befriends you. 

Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore him! 
All that has life and breath, come now with praises before him.
Let the ‘Amen!’ sound from his people again; gladly because we adore him.
