Lift up your voices and lift up your praise
Join with the heavens declaring the wonders
Of His faithfulness forever

Sing of the victory, the hope of the world
The Saviour has risen, the Spirit has come to
Bring us into love forever

Oh, we are the people of God
With the freedom of hope in our hearts
How great is the love of the Father

Lifted from darkness and into the light
The sons and the daughters are loved at a price
Our God has made us His forever

This is the song of the redeemed
The ransomed and the free
Given life at such a price
This is love, this is love
And when the Father calls us home
And we see Him on the throne
Hear the voices sing as one
This is love, this is love
