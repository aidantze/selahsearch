Before the skies were born
Before the oceans roared
Before the mountains reached for the burning stars
Through all Your words and ways
Through every promise made
Through every means of grace that reveals Your heart

You are unchanging, faithful, unfailing
Now and forevermore
God everlasting, sovereign, and reigning
Now and forevermore

In every season here
In waves of joy and tears
In all the ways our eyes only see in part
With every trial we face
With every test of faith
With our eternal hope written in Your scars

When earth and heaven fade
When sight has bloomed from faith
When we are home at last in our Savior's arms
Then all will be made right
Then every tear will dry
Then Your redeeming light will destroy the dark
