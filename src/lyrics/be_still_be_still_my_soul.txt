Should mountains melt into the roaring oceans
The earth give way or heaven’s lights grow cold
O mighty God, You are my strong defender
Be still, be still, my soul

When all I see are enemies before me
When unbelief and doubt have taken hold
O Lord of hosts, You promise to defeat them
Be still, be still, my soul

For You are God, I need not fear
You’re sovereign over all
For You are good and always near
I’ll rest in You alone
Be still, my soul

Though all around the wicked seem to prosper
They mock Your name and rise against Your throne
O righteous Judge, their deeds You will remember
Be still, be still, my soul

Though wars erupt, You will not leave us orphans
Though nations rage, You guard us as Your own
O, Prince of Peace, we will not be abandoned
Be still, be still, my soul
Be still, be still, my soul
