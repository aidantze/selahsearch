Here is love, vast as the ocean,
Loving-kindness as the flood;
When the Prince of Life, my ransom,
Shed for me his precious blood.
Who his love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing his praise?
He shall never be forgotten,
Through Heav’n’s everlasting days

On the mount of crucifixion,
Fountains opened deep and wide,
Through the flood-gates of God’s mercy,
Flowed the vast and gracious tide;
Grace and love, like mighty rivers
Poured incessant from above,
And God’s peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.

Let me all your love accepting,
Love you, ever all my days;
Let me seek your kingdom only
And my life be to your praise;
You alone will be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see;
You have cleansed and sanctified me,
Jesus you have set me free.
