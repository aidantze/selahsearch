I heard the voice of Jesus say, “Come unto me and rest
Lay down thou weary one, lay down thy head upon my chest.”
I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad
I found in him a resting place and he has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say, “Behold I freely give
The living water, thirsty one stoop down and drink and live.”
I came to Jesus and I drank of that life giving stream
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived and now I live in him

I heard the voice of Jesus say, “I am this dark world’s light
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise and all thy day be bright.”
I looked to Jesus and I found in him my Star, my Sun
And in that light of life I'll walk till travelling days are done
