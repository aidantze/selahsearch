Salvation, tearing through the dead of night
See the kingdom burst into colour at the speed of light
Freedom, shaking up the atmosphere
As the shadows fade into nothing as the day appears

Beyond the skies above
Love reaching out for us
The Everlasting One
Jesus our God

Oh we look to the Son
Set our eyes on our Saviour
See the image of love
Sing His praises forever
Oh we look to the Son

Creation, waking up to Kingdom come
See the hope of heaven shining like the rising sun
Now forever, lifted up from death to life
There's no fear in love and no darkness in His endless light

Beyond the skies above
Love reaching out for us
The Everlasting One
Jesus our God
Beyond the skies above
Love reaching out for us
The Everlasting One
Jesus our God
Oh we look to the Son
Oh we look to the Son
