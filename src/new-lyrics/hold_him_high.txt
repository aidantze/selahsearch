Before He spoke the Word
That laid the world's foundation
He knew us as beloved and adored
Set apart in love to be His new creations
Oh, that we would find in Him our great reward
Hold Him high, glorious Jesus Christ

Holiest Son of Man
Worthy and lifted lamb
Heaven's exalted King
He is our righteousness
Light of the world in us
There is no brighter love
Hold Him high, glorious Jesus Christ

The wonder of His will
Revealed in our redemption
It's only by His blood that we're made whole
For He is the way, the truth, the life forever
On the praises of the Church, He is enthroned
Hold Him high, glorious Jesus Christ

Holiest Son of Man
Worthy and lifted lamb
Heaven's exalted King
He is our righteousness
Light of the world in us
There is no brighter love
Hold Him high, glorious Jesus Christ

Holy, holy, God Almighty
Awesome eternal King and Christ
Heaven and earth sing, "He is worthy"
Lord over all be lifted high
Holy, holy, God Almighty
Awesome eternal King and Christ
Heaven and earth sing, "He is worthy"
Lord over all be lifted high
