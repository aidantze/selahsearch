Our Father who in Heaven reigns
How great and mighty is Your name
Your kingdom come, Your will be done
Now here on Earth as is above

Oh, give to us our daily bread
And keep our hungry spirits fed
May all our satisfaction be
In You whose grace has set us free

Give us hope, give us faith
Help us trust in Your guidance
From the depths of Your grace
You have richly provided
Thank You, thank You
Father, You are all we need
Father, You are all we need

Forgive us all our trespasses
As we forgive when sinned against
Though evil seeks to hide Your face
We fix our eyes on You by faith

Give us faith
Help us trust in Your guidance
From the depths of Your grace
You have richly provided
Thank You, thank You
Father, You are all we need
Father, You are all we need

We lift You high above all names
Your kingdom will forever reign
To You the glory and the power
Forevermore
