We hold to this confession
We come before the throne
Our confidence in nothing
But Jesus Christ alone
For right at the beginning
You gifted grace to us
So all would know Your glory
And never ending love
By grace alone on which we stand
The Father's heart His perfect plan
O Praise the Son who took our place
Now and always our Saving Grace
The Word made flesh completely
Descended here to earth
That all would see His mercy
A grace so undeserved
And in His love and kindness
To seek and save the lost
He gave the perfect offering
His life that paid the cost
By grace alone on which we stand
The Father's heart His perfect plan
O Praise the Son who took our place
Now and always our Saving Grace
There in the darkened garden
Our Saviour knelt and prayed
In love and full obedience
To take the cup away
Yet in His perfect timing
He walked up Calvary's hill
So He would bear our burdens
And do the Father's will
Three days the world was silent
The curtain torn in two
It seemed that death had conquered
But that was never true
For our King rose in victory
He defeated death and grave
And our lives are ever only
For the glory of His name
By grace alone on which we stand
The Father's heart His perfect plan
O Praise the Son who took our place
Now and always our Saving Grace
By grace alone on which we stand
The Father's heart His perfect plan
O Praise the Son who took our place
Now and always our Saving Grace
And on the final day
We'll stand before the throne
All justified completely
By grace and grace alone
