The wages of my sin was death
You knew I couldn't pay the debt
You paid it with Your final breath
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah
You took the wrath that I deserved
Your holy blood broke every curse
Your mercy had the final word
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah

We sing Christ and Christ crucified
In You, we're raised from death to life
We sing Christ and Christ crucified
Hallelujah, hallelujah

No sin is bigger than Your blood
No shame is stronger than Your love, ayy
'Cause You said, "It's finished, it is done"
Oh, hallelujah, hallеlujah
And death couldn't keep You in the ground
You rose in powеr, took Hell down
And that power's living in us now
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah

And death couldn't hold You down
Hell couldn't steal Your crown
There's resurrection power
In Your name, in Your name
And let all the earth cry out
Lift up a holy sound
Give all the glory now
To Jesus' name, Jesus' name
