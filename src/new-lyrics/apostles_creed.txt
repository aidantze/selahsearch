I believe in God the Father
Mighty and eternal Lord
He alone is the Creator
Forming all things by His word

I believe in our Lord Jesus
God's own Son who came to earth
Born a man, by the Spirit
By a virgin given birth

Sing praise to the Father
To the Spirit and the Son
Sing praise to our holy God
Forever three in one

I believe that Jesus suffered
On the cross He bore my shame
I believe that He was buried
Then triumphant rose again

Glorified, He has ascended
Seated at the Father's side
He will come again in judgement
Justice will be satisfied

I believe the Holy Spirit
Comes to us from Christ above
I believe the church is holy
One communion in God's love

I believe I am forgiven
Through the sacrifice of Christ
I believe in resurrection
And in everlasting life
