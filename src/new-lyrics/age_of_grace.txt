In this age of grace and favour
Jesus bids us come to Him
Every treasure heaven offers
Is for those who live in Him

I will set my mind on heaven above
I am raised forever with Him
For my life is hid with Christ in God
And in glory I will appear

In this age the ancients longed for
Weak and mighty, rich and poor
Sing together to their Saviour
One in hope they praise their Lord

I will set my mind on heaven above
I am raised forever with Him
For my life is hid with Christ in God
And in glory I will appear

We have been made alive in Christ
We're hidden in Him
We have been raised to glorious life
We're seated with Him

No more tears and no more weeping
No more darkness, no more sin
Though our trials here will linger
Jesus holds us safe in Him
Jesus holds us safe in Him
