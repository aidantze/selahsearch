You alone could light the heavens
Speak, and form the universe
Every grain and galaxy
Abiding by Your word
You alone deserve all glory
In one anthem, joyfully raised
Every language, every tongue
Resounding in Your praise

Every nation needs to know
There's salvation in Your name alone
For Your kingdom we must go
To all of the earth, all of the earth

You alone could ransom sinners
No one else could pay such price
Give for love Your perfect life
In humble sacrifice
You alone have conquered darkness
Death no longer wields its sting
Raised in power to reign forever
Jesus, King of Kings

You alone restore the broken
Through the weak display Your power
Strengthen us to persevere
Equip us for this hour
Christ alone our ceaseless message
Grace and peace our overflow
Surely You are always with us
Jesus, we will go
