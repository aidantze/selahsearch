You came to the world You created
Trading Your crown for a cross
You willingly died
Your innocent life paid the cost

Counting Your status as nothing
The King of all kings came to serve
Washing my feet
Covering me with Your love

If more of You
Means less of me
Take everything
Yes, all of You
Is all I need
Take everything

You are my life and my treasure
The One that I can’t live without
Here at Your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down
Here at Your feet my desires and dreams, I lay down

Oh Lord
Change me like only You can
Here with my heart in Your hands
Father, I pray
Make me more like Jesus
This world
Is dying to know who You are
You’ve shown us the way to Your heart
Father, I pray
Make me more like Jesus
More like Jesus
More like Jesus
