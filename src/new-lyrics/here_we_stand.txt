Here we stand, the church of the redeemed
Ransomed by the blood that sets us free
From the darkness, brought into the light
Enemies of God now His delight

From the depths, called to highest heights
Here we stand, the church of the redeemed
We are His, precious in His sight
Here we stand, the church of the redeemed

Here we stand, contending for the faith
Standing for the truth in every age
We are weak, but Jesus, He is strong
In the Spirit's power we labour on

And we know victory will be won!
Here we stand, contending for the faith
And we know truth will overcome
Here we stand, the church of the redeemed

Here we stand, but here we don't belong
Journeying toward our lasting home
Now we weep with weary saints who mourn
Telling all the world the hope of dawn

Christ will come, all will be restored!
Here we stand, but here we don't belong
We will wait, ready for our Lord
Here we stand, the church of the redeemed

Every heart overflows with praise
When at last we stand before the throne
And with our King, evermore we'll reign
Here we stand, the church of the redeemed
