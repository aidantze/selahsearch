Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You, oh, we live for You

Jesus, the name above every other name
Jesus, the only one who could ever save
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You, we live for You

Holy, there is no one like You, there is none beside You
Open up my eyes in wonder and
Show me who You are and fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love to those around me

Jesus, the name above every other name
Jesus, the only One who could ever save
You're worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You, oh, we live for You

And I will build my life upon Your love, it is a firm foundation
And I will put my trust in You alone, and I will not be shaken
And I will build my life upon Your love, it is a firm foundation
And I will put my trust in You alone, and I will not be shaken
